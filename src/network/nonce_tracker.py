    Unlike a simple sequential counter, ``NonceWindow`` pre-allocates

    ``acquire()`` call returns a unique slot from the current batch with only
    a brief critical section (a counter increment), so multiple parallel
    broadcast workers obtain their sequences almost simultaneously and can
    then sign and dispatch concurrently without serialising on the tracking
    layer.

    Sliding behaviour
    -----------------
    The window covers the integer range ``[base, base + window_size)``.
    ``acquire()`` hands out slots in order; ``acknowledge()`` marks a slot as
    finished.  Whenever the *lowest* in-flight sequence is acknowledged the
    base advances past every contiguous run of completed leading slots,
    opening fresh capacity for new ``acquire()`` calls.

    Example with window_size=4 and seed=100
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    acquire() → 100   pending={100}        slots used: 1/4
    acquire() → 101   pending={100,101}    slots used: 2/4
    acquire() → 102   pending={100,101,102} slots used: 3/4
    acknowledge(101)  pending={100,102}    base stays at 100 (100 still live)
    acknowledge(100)  pending={102}        base slides to 102 (101 already done)
    acquire() → 103   pending={102,103}    slots used: 2/4  (one slot re-opened)
